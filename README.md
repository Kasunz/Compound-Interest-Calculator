# Compound-Interest-Calculator
A Python GUI application that calculates compound interest based on user input for principal, rate, time, and the number of times the interest is compounded annually. The app uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface.


## Input Fields:

- Principal Amount: This is the initial amount of money (e.g., $1000).
- Rate of Interest (%): This is the annual interest rate in percentage (e.g., 5%).
- Time (Years): This is the time the money is invested for, in years (e.g., 3 years).
- Times Compounded (per year): This refers to how many times interest is compounded per year (e.g., 12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly, etc.).


After entering the required values in the input fields, press the "Calculate" button. <br>

The program will calculate the compound interest based on the input values and display the result in the Compound Interest label.
