# Compound-Interest-Calculator (Advanced Version)

A Python GUI application that calculates compound interest based on user input for principal, rate, time, and the number of times the interest is compounded annually. The app uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## New Features:
- **Colored User Interface**: The labels, buttons, and window background now have colors to make the interface more visually appealing.
- **Reset Button**: A "Reset" button has been added to clear all the input fields and the result, making it easier to perform multiple calculations.

## Input Fields:

- **Principal Amount**: This is the initial amount of money (e.g., $1000).
- **Rate of Interest (%)**: This is the annual interest rate in percentage (e.g., 5%).
- **Time (Years)**: This is the time the money is invested for, in years (e.g., 3 years).
- **Times Compounded (per year)**: This refers to how many times interest is compounded per year (e.g., 12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly, etc.).

## How to Use:
1. Enter the required values in the input fields.
2. Press the "Calculate" button to compute the compound interest.
3. The result will be displayed under the "Compound Interest" label.
4. To reset the input fields and result, press the "Reset" button.
